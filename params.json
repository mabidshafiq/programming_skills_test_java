The program should print the area of the square.\r\n\r\nDefinitions:\r\n\r\nVolume of cube = a*a*a, where a is the side of a cube\r\n\r\nArea of Square = b*b, where b is the side of the square\r\n\r\nFor example, let us suppose the following is the volume inputted to the program:\r\n\r\nINPUT\r\n\r\n8\r\n27\r\nThen the corresponding output will be as follows:\r\n\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\n1\r\n2.25\r\n\r\n# 4. First and last digit of the sum\r\n\r\nWrite a program which will accept a number as its input. You are required to calculate the sum of the first and last digits of the square of the number given as inp ut. In case the square of the number is a single digit number then the square should be printed as it is.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us suppose the following input is given to the program:\r\n\r\nINPUT\r\n\r\n3\r\n5\r\n6\r\nThen the corresponding output should be:\r\n\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\n9\r\n7\r\n9\r\n\r\n# 5. Number to ASCII\r\n\r\nWrite a program that accepts a number of ASCII values between 40 and 125 (both inclusive) and concatenates the corresponding characters to form a string. The progra m accepts a multi-line input. The first line contains a number representing how many ASCII values are in the input. The subsequent lines contain the ASCII values th emselves (one ASCII value per line).\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of a valid input:\r\n\r\nINPUT\r\n\r\n5 (this indicates the total number of ASCII values in the input set)\r\n65\r\n67\r\n69\r\n70\r\n71\r\nThe output is printed as a string. The ASCII value of A is 65, C is 67, E is 69, F is 70, G is 71 and therefore the output will be as follows:\r\n\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\nACEFG\r\n\r\n# 6. Sort racers\r\n\r\nDuring a car rally the time keeper wrote down the driver names along with their finishing positions in random order.

If the password meets the conditions then \"VALID\" should be printed, else \"INVAL ID\" should be printed.\r\n\r\nINPUT\r\n\r\na2\r\nabcdEF12\r\nabcdEF12(*\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\nINVALID\r\nVALID\r\nVALID\r\n\r\n# 10. Divisors\r\n\r\nWrite a program that evaluates the sum of all the divisors of a given number, other than the number itself. For example, if the number if 14, the divisors are 1,2,7 and 14. If we exclude 14, the sum of the remaining divisors will be 1+2+7 = 10.\r\n\r\nThe program accepts a multi-line input. The first line contains a number representing how many numbers are being inputted. Subsequent lines contain the numbers them selves. The inputted numbers should be between 1 and 100000 (inclusive). The output should be printed one per line corresponding to the sum of the divisors of the p articular inputted number.\r\n\r\nBelow is some example input and output:\r\n\r\nINPUT\r\n\r\n4 (this represents how many numbers exist in the input set)\r\n13\r\n15\r\n10\r\n6\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\n1\r\n9\r\n8\r\n6\r\nNote: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.\r\n\r\n# 11. RGB numbers\r\n\r\nWrite a program which will convert the given RGB input values into the corresponding hexadecimal values preceded with a # sign.\r\n\r\nA single input sequence will be provided, consisting of RGB values separated by \"-\". Each RGB combination will be separated by \",\". The outputs should be comma sepa rated and in uppercase. Also, it should be checked if a color value is greater than 255. In such a case, the output for the corresponding combination should be give n as INVALID.\r\n\r\nNote: Number 10, which has a hexadecimal value of A, must be represented as \"0A\" and not as \"A\". The same rule applies to other single digit hexadecimal numbers.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\nSuppose the following input sequence is supplied to the program:\r\n\r\nINPUT\r\n\r\n12-13-14,45-156-23,234-234-256\r\nOUTPUT\r\n\r\n0C0D0E,#2D9C17,INVALID\r\n\r\n# 12.
